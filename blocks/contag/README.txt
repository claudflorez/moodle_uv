ConTag (Concept Tagging) - For Moodle 2

Author: ICTG Group, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand

Bugfix release 2013-03-21
------------------------------
ConTag allows a teacher to easily tag Moodle items with concepts, that the student can then use to browse the items. A student can use this to focus on concepts that they are interested in.

Installation:
Place the ConTag folder in the moodle/htdocs/blocks folder, then go to the Notifications menu item within Moodle.

Once installed and the block has been added to a course, a teacher will be given two options via the block area: Edit Concept Tags (i.e. tag items), and Navigate by Concept Tags. A student will just be given Navigate by Concept Tags.


Features
--------
Tagging (for Teachers):
Add tag
Add multiple tags to an item (separated by commas)
Add tags to several items at once (type them in where you want, then hit "Save" or press "enter")
